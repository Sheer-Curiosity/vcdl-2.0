# VCDL2
A Python rewrite of the original VCDL/HoloClipper PowerShell script.

VCDL2 retains much of the functionality of the original script. As with the original, it was purpose-written to specifications outlined by the HoloResort Translations team, however the program is open for all to use.

## Installation
Download the executable file from Releases, and place it wherever you like. It's advised to add it to your system PATH if possible. You can also build the program yourself using the `build.py` script. The `master` branch code should always be safe to build. Building on Windows has been tested and verified working. Building on Linux is supported, but only tested using a WSL2 shell as of writing (NOTE: you will have to build ffmpeg yourself on Linux). MacOS support will be added in a future update.

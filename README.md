# VCDL2
A Python rewrite of the original VCDL/HoloClipper PowerShell script.

VCDL2 retains much of the functionality of the original script. As with the original, it was purpose-written to specifications outlined by the HoloResort Translations team, however the program is open for all to use.

## Installation
At the moment, VCDL2 is still in active development, and has no prebuilt binaries. However, you can build the program yourself using the `build.py` script. The program only has support for Windows builds at the moment. Linux support will come in future updates.

## New Features TODO:

### High Priority

- Multi-Link Video Stitching
- QT-Based GUI
- More detailed error reporting

### Medium Priority

- Integrated batch downloading
- Wider video site support

### Low Priority

- Improvements to downloading process efficiency
